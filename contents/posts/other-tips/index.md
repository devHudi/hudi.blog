## How to change the favicon?

The favicon is located in `src/images/gatsby-icons.png`. If you replace that image, the favicon will change.

If you want to change the name of the favicon, change the `icon` property of `gatsby-plugin-manifest` in `gatsby-config.js`.

## Utterance is not working properly.
